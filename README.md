#  Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships that influenced survival outcomes.

##  Dataset Description

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- **Features** include: `PassengerId`, `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Overview** â€“ shape, columns, types, missing values
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ handling missing values and anomalies
3. **Univariate Analysis** â€“ distribution of individual variables
4. **Bivariate Analysis** â€“ relationships with survival
5. **Correlation Heatmap** â€“ numeric feature relationships
6. **Categorical Analysis** â€“ survival based on class, sex, embarkation
7. **Age Binning & Family Size Features** â€“ feature engineering

##  Key Insights

- Females had much higher survival rates than males.
- 1st-class passengers had the highest survival probability.
- Children (age < 10) had improved survival chances.
- Port of Embarkation impacted survival rates.
- Passengers traveling alone had a lower survival rate.

##  Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical computation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization

---

##  Future Enhancements

- Feature engineering (Title extraction, cabin processing)
- Build predictive ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
